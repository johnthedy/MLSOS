# MLSOS
Optimization Algorithm using Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) to find optimal machine learning including its hyperparameters
Current code using normal concrete as dataset obtained from Yeh. 1998

SOS is given 3 machine learning option (ANN, SVM, ensemble tree)
The algorithm will find best machine learning among three option, including the hyperparameters that could yield least error performance

User can modify objective function in fobjSOS, or include more machine learning model.
